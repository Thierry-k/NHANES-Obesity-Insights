## NHANES Data Projects (Using `aplore3` R Package)

These projects use data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), accessed via the `aplore3` R package, to explore public health patterns and build predictive models related to obesity and lifestyle.

### üîç Project 6: Does Physical Activity Reduce the Likelihood of Obesity?

This analysis investigates whether engaging in physical activity‚Äîsuch as vigorous or moderate work, recreational activities, or walking/biking‚Äîis associated with a lower likelihood of being obese.

**Techniques Used:**
- Logistic regression  
- Chi-square tests of independence  
- Contingency tables and row proportion analysis  
- Data visualization using `ggplot2`

### üìâ Project 9: Does Physical Activity Differ Across Marital Statuses?

This project examines how levels of physical activity vary across different marital status groups, providing insight into behavioral differences by relationship status.

**Techniques Used:**
- Crosstab analysis  
- Chi-square tests  
- Row proportion calculations  
- Bar plots and grouped comparisons

### ü§ñ Project 11: Predicting Obesity Based on Health and Lifestyle Data

A classification model is built to predict whether an individual is obese based on variables such as physical activity, smoking status, alcohol use, general health, and demographics.

**Techniques Used:**
- Data cleaning and factor transformation  
- Logistic regression modeling  
- Feature selection and interpretation  
- Model evaluation: confusion matrix, accuracy, AUC

Each project includes annotated R code, tables, and visual summaries to highlight findings. These analyses aim to extract meaningful public health insights from real-world data.
